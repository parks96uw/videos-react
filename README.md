A simple application that searches videos off of the Youtube Data V3 API and populates a list of similar videos based off of the search term. You can select a video to play in the main part of the page.

This was created using React and the Youtube Data V3 API. The Youtube API requires the use of an access key and can also restrict where it is being called from in it's configuration.

To start this application, `cd` into the main folder and run `npm start`
